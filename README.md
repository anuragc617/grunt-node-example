# Grunt "init:node" example

This is example output generated by the "grunt init:node" task.

_Note: this repository was generated dynamically using grunt v0.3.8. Instead of
reporting issues here, please report any issues with this repository as
[grunt issues][issues]. Instead of watching or forking this repository,
watch [grunt][grunt] and use the grunt [init task][init]._

## Project Creation Transcript
The following is a transcript of the session in which this project and
repository were created. This is not actually a part of the [grunt][grunt]
"init:node" template, this session transcript was added afterwards. The
text after the `$` are the commands that were executed, and everything else is
program output. If you want to see the repository exactly as it was created by
grunt, view [the previous commit][prev].

Note that this entire build process is automated by a rather complex [expect
script][expect], which is used to automate grunt in order to facilitate the
creation of this and other [init task][init] example repositories.

```
$ mkdir grunt-node-example && cd grunt-node-example

$ git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:cowboy/grunt-node-example.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/grunt-node-example/.git/

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:cowboy/grunt-node-example.git

$ grunt init:node
Running "init:node" (init) task
This task will create one or more files in the current directory, based on the
environment and the answers to a few questions. Note that answering "?" to any
question will show question-specific help and answering "none" to most questions
will leave its value blank.

"node" template notes:
Project name shouldn't contain "node" or "js" and should be a unique ID not
already in use at search.npmjs.org.
